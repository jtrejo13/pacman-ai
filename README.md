# The PacMan Projects

## [Overview](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html)

The Pac-Man projects were developed for UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. These projects, however, don't focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

## Motivation

I will be working on the PacMan projects this semester as I am auditing UT's course on artificial intelligence, [CS 343](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/sniekum/classes/343-S18/desc.php), taught by [Dr. Scott Niekum] (http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/sniekum/)

## Projects Overview

### Search
Implementation of depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the PacMan world.


### Multi-Agent Search
Classic PacMan is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Here, multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions are implemented.


### Reinforcement Learning
Implementation model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, PacMan, and a simulated crawling robot.


### Ghostbusters
Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the PacMan world. Exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters is implemented.


### Classification
Implementation of standard machine learning classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA models to classify digits. A behavioral cloning PacMan agent is also implemented.


### Contest: Pacman Capture the Flag
Creation of strategies for a team of two agents to play a multi-player capture-the-flag variant of PacMan.
